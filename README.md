# vast
takes a set of pngs vast1 to vast263

takes json file with coordinates that can be traveled for each image, {"vast1":"nsew","vast2":"sew"}

makes a map

{"vast1":{"n":"vast2","s":"vast3","e":"vast4","w":"vast5"},"vast2":{"s":"vast1","e":"vast6","w":"vast7"},"vast3":{"n":"vast1","s":"vast8","e":"vast9","w":"vast10"}}

map is random, maximizes the number of relationships possible btw images

cassie uses phaser to control Jennifer's motion, fade ins, etc

i'm so sorry about the variable names
